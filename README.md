### üí° Core Features (Quiz Engine & Data Management)

* **Customizable Quiz Experience**: Users can tailor their quiz by selecting from diverse topics and adjusting key settings.
    * **Topic Selection**: Users can choose one or more topics from a list that includes General Knowledge, Science & Nature, Technology, History, Sports, and Entertainment.
    * **Difficulty Levels**: Quizzes can be set to "Easy," "Medium," or "Hard" difficulty.
    * **Question Count**: The number of questions per quiz is adjustable to 5, 10, or 15.
    * **Time Limits**: A time limit can be set for each question (e.g., 30 or 60 seconds) or disabled entirely.
* **Stand-Out Features**:
    * **Intelligent Question Generation**: The platform fetches questions from the Open Trivia Database API to ensure a wide variety of up-to-date content. If the API is unavailable, a comprehensive set of fallback questions is used to ensure the quiz can still be played offline.
    * **Detailed Results & Review**: After completing a quiz, users are presented with a detailed results screen that shows their score, percentage, number of correct and incorrect answers, and total time taken. They can then review each question to see the correct answer, their selected answer, and a brief explanation.
    * **Gamified Elements**: The user's performance is celebrated with a dynamic trophy icon and a customized subtitle on the results screen based on their score. A vibrant `score-circle` animation and a "shimmering" effect on the progress bar add to the engaging feel.
    * **Persistent User Data**: The platform saves user preferences, including selected topics and theme choices, to `localStorage`, so settings persist across sessions. It also tracks quiz statistics, such as total quizzes taken, average score, and best score, to provide a progress overview.
* **Interactive and Dynamic UI**: The user interface is highly interactive, with smooth transitions, animations, and visual feedback for user actions. Elements like the progress bar, score display, and buttons provide real-time updates and animations.

### üé® User Interface & Experience

MystIQ provides a visually rich and responsive user interface:

* **Multi-Theming**: MystIQ offers five distinct color themes‚ÄîCyberpunk (default), Forest, Ocean, Sunset, and Cosmic‚Äîallowing users to personalize the look and feel of the platform. The theme can be toggled via a navigation button.
* **Immersive Design**: The design incorporates modern aesthetics such as "glassmorphism" with `backdrop-filter: blur()`, gradients, and a responsive layout.
* **Responsive Layout**: The application's layout adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes, ensuring optimal viewing and interaction on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **Accessibility**: The design includes features for accessibility, such as keyboard navigation for quiz answers and reduced motion support.
* **Clear Information Hierarchy**: Content is logically organized into distinct sections, making it easy for users to find information about different aspects of the quiz process.
